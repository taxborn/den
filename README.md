# Den

My website, written in Rust. I've tried a few different frameworks - [Astro](https://astro.build) being my favorite -
but I've always wondered what it would be like to write my own website generator.

## Requirements

- Fast to compile, easy deployments
- Use GitHub CI to deploy
- CSP security, passes Google Lighthouse checks
- Parses Markdown with frontmatter

# Deployments
*This is not setup yet*

For now, while developing this, there will be two subdomains under taxborn.com

- [den.taxborn.com](https://den.taxborn.com) - the **main** branch
- [den-next.taxborn.com](https://den-next.taxborn.com) - the **next** branch
