# Den

My website, written in Rust. I've tried a few different frameworks - [Astro](https://astro.build) being my favorite -
but I've always wondered what it would be like to write my own website generator.

## Requirements

- Fast to compile, easy deployments
- Use GitHub CI to deploy
- CSP security, passes Google Lighthouse checks
- Parses Markdown with frontmatter
